# Data_Distributions_And_Football

## Overview

This tests your understanding of the concepts, math, and programming required to learn distributions from data. You are required to perform a mixture of derivations and programming to solve the questions.  

**READ the problem statements CAREFULLY!**  

**IMPORTANT**: The RMarkdown assumes you have downloaded two data sets (CSV files) and saved them to the same directory you saved the template Rmarkdown file. If you do not have the CSV files in the correct location, the data will not be loaded correctly.
